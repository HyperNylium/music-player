:: NOTES
:: The purpose of this "if exist "%temp%\getadmin.vbs" del "%temp%\getadmin.vbs""
:: is to clean up any previous instances of the getadmin.vbs script
:: that might have been created in the user's temporary directory.
:: This is done to ensure that there are no lingering 
:: or conflicting scripts from previous runs.
:: and the getadmin.vbs script is a Visual Basic Script (VBS) used in the batch script 
:: to request administrative privileges when running a batch file.
::
:: UAC stands for "User Account Control".
